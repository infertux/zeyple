### File name containing the body a notification email to be sent
### when no key is found. There is a nice default, however you
### may wish to give the recipient more specific instruction
### how to get his key on your system. The file must be encoded
### in UTF-8:

# missing_key_notification_file = /etc/zeyple.notify

### Subject for this email:

# missing_key_notification_subject = Fix it!

[missing_key_rules]
### This rules define, what to do if the recipient has no key. The rules
### have the format:
###
###    <regexp> = drop|notify|cleartext
###
### The recipient address will be matched against <regexp> using the Python
### module 're'. The actions have this effect:
###
### - drop: Discards the message silently.
### - notify: Send a notification to the recipient
###
### Examples:
###
### The toystory people never get important stuff and don't know how to use PGP:
###
###    .*\@toystory\.com$ = cleartext
###
### The new default - always notify:
###
###    . = notify
###
### The old behavior with "force_encrypt = 1" - in doubt drop the message:
###
###    . = drop
###
### The old behavior with "force_encrypt = 0" - sent messages without encryption
### if we lack the key:
###
###    . = cleartext
###
### Order matters! First match wins - at least with Python 2.7+.
